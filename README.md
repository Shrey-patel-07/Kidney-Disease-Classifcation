## Introduction
Kidney Disease Classification is a project utilizing deep learning techniques to classify Kidney Tumor and Stone diseases from [medical images dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nazmul0087/ct-kidney-dataset-normal-cyst-tumor-and-stone/). This project leverages the power of Deep Learning, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices, Data Version Control (DVC). It integrates with DagsHub for collaboration and versioning.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient deep-learning model that can accurately classify kidney tumors and Stone from medical images. This could include but is not limited to, identifying different stages of cancer, detecting anomalies in X-rays, or diagnosing skin diseases through dermatological imaging.

## Importance of the Project
- **Enhancing Healthcare**: By providing accurate and quick disease classification, this project aims to improve patient care and diagnostic accuracy significantly.
- **Research and Development**: It serves as a tool for researchers to analyze medical images more effectively, paving the way for discoveries in the medical field.
- **Educational Value**: This project can be a learning platform for students and professionals interested in deep learning and medical image analysis.

## Technical Overview
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Utilizes popular frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the classification models.
- **Data Version Control (DVC)**: Manages and versions large datasets and machine learning models, ensuring reproducibility and streamlined data pipelines.
- **Git Integration**: For source code management and version control, making the project easily maintainable and scalable.
- **MLOps Practices**: Incorporates best practices in machine learning operations to automate workflows, from data preparation to model deployment.
- **DagsHub Integration**: Facilitates collaboration, data and model versioning, experiment tracking, and more in a user-friendly platform.
